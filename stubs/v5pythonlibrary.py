class InertialWrapper(Inertial):
    '''
    ### Wraps the Inertial class to add scaling correction

    API matches that of Inertial with a couple of helper functions added.

    Upon creation a scale factor must be provided along with the port number. This is the correction that needs to \\
    be aplied to get the correct reading. E.g. if a robot it turned 360 degrees and the gyro reads 355 degrees, then \\
    the scale factor should be 360 / 355 (or 1.0141). Another way to determine this is to use a rroutine such as \\
    SmartDrive.turn_for() to turn the robot by 360 degrees. The resulting error in heading will be the inverse of \\
    the scale factor, meaning that if the robot turns by 365 degrees when instructed to turn 360 degrees, the scale \\
    factor is 365 / 360 (or 1.0139). In practice we would use several turns, say 10, in both directions as the error \\
    becomes more visible and easy to measure.

    ### Arguments
        port: port number
        gyro_scale: this is the READOUT scale factor needed to produce the correct reading for a given robot turn

        Instance of InertialWrapper

class Tracking:
    '''
    ### Tracking class to calculate robot position using tracking wheels or motor encoders plus inertial sensor

    Internally everything is based in meters and radians
    To distinguish from VEX uses for various heading readings, we use the following terminology:
    - ROTATION: continuous rotation value in degrees (can be positive or negative, no bounds)
    - HEADING: bounded heading in degrees [0, 360)
    - ANGLE: bounded angle in degrees (-180, +180]
    - THETA: continuous rotation value in radians (can be positive or negative, no bounds). Same as ROTATION but in radians
    THETA is used internally and converted to/from HEADING/ANGLE as needed
    
    Note that  __init__() and update_location() assume that the gyro scale factor has already been applied to the inertial sensor readings

        The robot is commanded to turn by specified angle either LEFT or RIGHT. Note that turning by negative amount\\

        1. direction : The direction to turn, LEFT or RIGHT
        2. angle : The angle to turn
        3. units (optional) : The units for the provided angle (DEGREES only)

    This class implements driver control for a tank drive robot using a left and right motor group and an inertial sensor.
    It includes features such as:
    - Deadband handling to prevent motor creep

    - Detwitching to reduce turn sensitivity at low speeds
    - Gyro-based straight driving assistance
    - Selctable brake modes
