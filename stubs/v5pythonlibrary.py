class InertialWrapper(Inertial):
    '''
    ### Wraps the Inertial class to add scaling correction

    API matches that of Inertial with a couple of helper functions added.

    Upon creation a scale factor must be provided along with the port number. This is the correction that needs to \\
    be aplied to get the correct reading. E.g. if a robot it turned 360 degrees and the gyro reads 355 degrees, then \\
    the scale factor should be 360 / 355 (or 1.0141). Another way to determine this is to use a rroutine such as \\
    SmartDrive.turn_for() to turn the robot by 360 degrees. The resulting error in heading will be the inverse of \\
    the scale factor, meaning that if the robot turns by 365 degrees when instructed to turn 360 degrees, the scale \\
    factor is 365 / 360 (or 1.0139). In practice we would use several turns, say 10, in both directions as the error \\
    becomes more visible and easy to measure.

    ### Arguments
        port: port number
        gyro_scale: this is the READOUT scale factor needed to produce the correct reading for a given robot turn

    ### Tracking class to calculate robot position using tracking wheels or motor encoders plus inertial sensor

    Internally everything is based in meters and radians
    To distinguish from VEX uses for various heading readings, we use the following terminology:
    - ROTATION: continuous rotation value in degrees (can be positive or negative, no bounds)
    - HEADING: bounded heading in degrees [0, 360)
    - ANGLE: bounded angle in degrees (-180, +180]
    - THETA: continuous rotation value in radians (can be positive or negative, no bounds). Same as ROTATION but in radians
    THETA is used internally and converted to/from HEADING/ANGLE as needed
    
    Note that  __init__() and update_location() assume that the gyro scale factor has already been applied to the inertial sensor readings

    ### SmartDriveWrapper class - use this to create a smart(er) drivetrain

        - Drivetrain (vex)
            - SmartDrive (vex)
                - SmartDriveWrapper (this class)

    This version extends the SmartDrive functionality by impplementing heading hold when driving straight through
    the drive_straight_for() function.
    
    It also implements full control over PID supporting Kp, Ki and Kd for turning, driving
    and heading hold. Three new functions are added to support this:\\
        - set_turn_constants()\\
        - set_drive_constantss()\\
        - set_heading_lock_constants()\\

    It is also based on the InertialWrapper class that provides scaling for gyros with a (constant) heading error.
